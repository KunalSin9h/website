The code blocks on the documentation site and the blog are powered by [rehype-pretty-code](https://github.com/atomiks/rehype-pretty-code). The syntax highlighting is done using [shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki).

It has the following features:

1. Beautiful code blocks with syntax highlighting.
2. Support for VS Code themes.
3. Works with hundreds of languages.
4. Line and word highlighting.
5. Support for line numbers.
6. Show code block titles using meta strings.

## Example

```ts showLineNumbers title="next.config.js" {3} /appDir: true/
import { withContentlayer } from "next-contentlayer";

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  images: {
    domains: ["avatars.githubusercontent.com"],
  },
  experimental: {
    appDir: true,
    serverComponentsExternalPackages: ["@prisma/client"],
  },
};

export default withContentlayer(nextConfig);
```

## Title

```ts title="path/to/file.ts"
// Code here
```

## Line Highlight

```ts {1,3-6}
// Highlight line 1 and line 3 to 6
```

## Word Highlight

```ts /shadcn/
// Highlight the word shadcn.
```

## Line Numbers

```ts showLineNumbers
// This will show line numbers.
// This will show line numbers.
// This will show line numbers.
// This will show line numbers.
```
