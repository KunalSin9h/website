### Using Pulumi, Azure, Nginx and geoDNS created a distributed server network for content delivery.
Although this architecture can be used for creating anything which need to be deployed as **\`per user location\`** basis.

For example

- Content Delivery Network
- Global  HTTPS Cache using Varnish
- Distributed Deployments
- And so on...

#### In this very blog, we are just going to see CDN

**CDN** - _Content Delivery Network_

<BlogImage

CDN are server used for delivering content - images, videos, audios, texts and blog for naming few. These are located 
on every location where there is significant human population is present.

In the example image above, I have shown how can Company (or even we) place server at different location and create a logic to 
distribute request depending on client location to nearest server.

    width={432}
    height={306}
/>

#### What logic ?

It can be `geoDNS`, `geoDistance`, `Weighted Shuffle` and `Anycast`.

> Go and read about them, Here is TL;DR

- *geoDNS* : Every server has unique **IP**, we distribute request on the basis os IP, ASN, Region, Continent, Country.

    <summary>See example image</summary>

        <BlogImage 
            src="https://i.imgur.com/Zt22jto.png"
            alt="GeoDNS example"
            width={1100}
            height={753}
        />

    </details>

- *geoDistance* : Every server has unique **IP**, we distribute request on the basis nearest server, by calculating shortest distance. 

- *Weighted Shuffle* : Random order with weights - Mainly for preventing DDoS 

- *Anycast*: All the server has same **IP**, request goes to nearest server using *BGP* Protocol. 

    <details>
    <summary>See example image</summary>

        <BlogImage 
            src="https://i.imgur.com/cigYslY.png"
            alt="Anycast example"
            width={1100}
            height={753}
        />

    </details>

> Here *we* means the *DNS* Server.

_Anycast_ is hard to achieve, since involve working with hardware and network layer and publishing same IP for all server.  _Weighed Shuffle_ is not want we want. 
So we are going to use _geoDNS_ and _geoDistance_.

That was a brief about CDNs, now lets talk about creating one. 

# Creating a Custom CDN Network. 

We are gonna use ...

> If you don't want to do these steps exactly similar, then you can do it your way. The core
> idea same.

1. Azure for creating Virtual Machines at 3 different locations

    To do this, we are using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) - An _Infrastructure as Code_ platform 

2. Nginx for _Static contents serving_

    To do this we will use [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)

3. [Gcore](https://www.pulumi.com/) for DNS with Free geoDNS service. 

    Other DNS service providers, like Cloudflare does not have geoDNS for Free - Its only for Enterprise users.

4. Finally upload _Contents_ to our _Content Delivery Network_

    To do this we also use **Ansible**

## Creating Virtual Machines - Our Servers

The task is to create multiple server (virtual machine) at different locations, and get unique *IP Address* of all.

I'm going to create 7 servers at these locations:

-   "Central India"
-   "Central US"
-   "West Europe"

<br />
<details>
    <summary>See how to do it with **Terraform**</summary>

    The source code for this terraform infra setup will be found [here](https://github.com)

    We created our Virtual Machine map

    ```hcl title="variables.tf"
    variable "vm_map" {
        type = map(object({
            name     = string
            location = string
            size     = string
        }))

        default = {
            "vm1" = {
                name = "centralindia"
                location = "Central India"
                size = "Standard_B1s"
            }

            "vm2" = {
                name = "centralus"
                location = "Central US"
                size = "Standard_B1s"
            }

            "vm3" = {
                name = "westeurope"
                location = "West Europe"
                size = "Standard_B1s"
            }
        }
    }
    ```    
    And the main file, which created all other resources is

    ```hcl title="main.tf"
    terraform {
        required_providers {
            azurerm = {
                source = "hashicorp/azurerm"
                version = "~> 3.0.2"
            }
        }

        required_version = ">= 1.8.5"
    }

    provider "azurerm" {
        features {
            resource_group {
                prevent_deletion_if_contains_resources = false
            }
        }
    }

    resource "azurerm_resource_group" "custom-cdn" {
        name = "custom-cdn-ResourceGroup"
        location = "Central India" # location has no effect
        # since resouce group is just a container for other resource
    }

    resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "custom-cdn" {
        for_each = var.vm_map

        name = "${each.value.name}-VNET"
        location = each.value.location
        address_space = [ "10.0.0.0/16" ]
        resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.custom-cdn.name
    }

    resource "azurerm_subnet" "custom-cdn" {
        for_each = var.vm_map

        name = "${each.value.name}-Subnet"
        resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.custom-cdn.name
        virtual_network_name = azurerm_virtual_network.custom-cdn[each.key].name  
        address_prefixes = [ "10.0.1.0/24" ]
    }

    resource "azurerm_public_ip" "custom-cdn" {
        for_each = var.vm_map

        name = "${ each.value.name }-PublicIp"
        location = each.value.location
        resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.custom-cdn.name
        allocation_method = "Static"
    }

    resource "azurerm_network_interface" "custom-cdn" {
        for_each = var.vm_map

        name = "${ each.value.name }-NIC"
        location = each.value.location
        resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.custom-cdn.name

        ip_configuration {
            name = "${each.value.name}-public"
            subnet_id = azurerm_subnet.custom-cdn[each.key].id
            public_ip_address_id = azurerm_public_ip.custom-cdn[each.key].id
            private_ip_address_allocation = "Dynamic"
        }
    }

    resource "azurerm_virtual_machine" "custom-cdn" {
        for_each = var.vm_map

        name = "${ each.value.name }-VM"
        location = each.value.location
        resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.custom-cdn.name
        network_interface_ids = [ azurerm_network_interface.custom-cdn[each.key].id ]
        vm_size = each.value.size

        storage_image_reference {
            publisher = "Canonical"
            offer     = "0001-com-ubuntu-server-jammy"
            sku       = "22_04-lts-gen2"
            version   = "latest"
        }

        storage_os_disk {
            name              = "${ each.value.name }-OsDisk"
            caching           = "ReadWrite"
            create_option     = "FromImage"
            managed_disk_type = "Standard_LRS"
        }

        os_profile {
            computer_name  = each.value.name
            admin_username = "custom-cdn"
            admin_password = "Password1234!"
        }

        os_profile_linux_config {
            disable_password_authentication = false
        }
    }

    output "custom_cdn_public_ip" {
        value = {
            for vm in azurerm_public_ip.custom-cdn : vm.name => vm.ip_address
        }
    }  
    ```

    > See the admin password is `Password1234!` - Change this to more secure one.

    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```
    We will get all the **IP** Address.

    ```bash
    # This will also print the output
    terraform output
    ```

</details>

After creating the Virtual Machines, we will have all the **IP** address as.

```hcl
custom_cdn_public_ip = {
  "centralindia-PublicIp" = "4.213.167.247"
  "centralus-PublicIp" = "40.86.90.42"
  "westeurope-PublicIp" = "4.180.232.216"
}
```

## Serving Static Contents using Nginx

The task is to login to each virtual machine and setup **nginx** and start serving
static content - files and folders.

<br />
<details>
    <summary>See how to do it with **Ansible**</summary>

    The source code for this ansible is in `infra` folder [here](https://github.com)

    After we got all the **IP** Address of all VMs. Create a `inventory.ini` file for storing all this data, which ansible take as input.  

    ```ini title="inventory.ini"
    [azure_vms]
    central-india location=central-india ansible_host=[HOST IP] ansible_user=custom-cdn ansible_ssh_pass=Password1234!
    central-us location=central-us ansible_host=[HOST IP] ansible_user=custom-cdn ansible_ssh_pass=Password1234!
    west-europe location=west-europe ansible_host=[HOST IP] ansible_user=custom-cdn ansible_ssh_pass=Password1234!
    ```

    Replace `[HOST IP]` with server IP address.

    To install and setup nginx, create a `nginx.conf` in the same directory.

    ```nginx title="nginx.conf"
    server { 
        listen 80;
        server_name {{ domain_name }};

        add_header X-Server-Location {{ location }};
        autoindex on;

        root /home/custom-cdn/contents;
    }
    ```

    and now create an `Ansible Playbook` file. 

    ```yml title="setup_nginx.yml"
    - name: Install NGINX on all VMs
        hosts: azure_vms
        become: yes
        vars:
            domain_name: cdn.kunals.me
        tasks:
            - name: Update apt cache
            apt:
                update_cache: yes
            
            - name: Create a new contents directory
            file:
                path: /home/custom-cdn/contents
                state: directory
                mode: "0755"

            - name: Install NGINX
            apt:
                name: nginx
                state: present

            - name: Create NGINX configuration for new domain
            template:
                src: nginx.conf
                dest: /etc/nginx/sites-available/{{ domain_name }}.conf
            notify:
                - Restart NGINX

            - name: Enable new NGINX site
            file:
                src: /etc/nginx/sites-available/{{ domain_name }}.conf
                dest: /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/{{ domain_name }}.conf
                state: link
            notify:
                - Restart NGINX

        handlers:
            - name: Restart NGINX
                service:
                    name: nginx
                    state: restarted
    ```

    and finally in the same directory. Create Ansible configuration file, `ansible.cfg`

    ```cfg title="ansible.cfg"
    [defaults]
    host_key_checking = false
    ```

    After these files, we are ready to run the playbook.

    > make sure you have `sshpass` installed on your system. Ansible require it.

    Run the _playbook_

    ```bash
    ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini setup_nginx.yml
    ```
    
    This will install nginx on all server, create _nginx.conf_ file in right place and restart nginx. 

</details>

<br />
<details>
    <summary>See how to do it Manually</summary>

    _FOR EACH SERVER_

    To Login we use SSH 

    ```bash
    ssh custom-cdn@10.10.10.10

    # custom-cdn is each machines username
    # replace 10.10.10.10 to actual server ip
    ```

    Create a folder where all the contents reside.

    ```bash
    mkdir contents

    # pwd
    # /home/custom-cdn/contents
    ```

    _Install nginx and make sure its running._

    > Open the **IP** address in the browser you must see nginx page

    Edit the `nginx.conf` to add current user.

    edit file `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`

    ```diff
    - user www-data;
    + user custom-cdn;
    ```

    Restart nginx

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart nginx
    ```
    Lets write a configuration  at `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/`

    Create a new file

    ```bash
    sudo vim cdn.kunals.me
    # choose any domain you want
    ```
    And write this 

    ```nginx
    server {

        listen 80;
        serve_name cdn.kunals.me;

        add_header X-Server-Location centalindia; # place your sever location name here

        autoindex on;
        root /home/custom-cdn/contents;
    }
    ```

    Reload nginx

    ```bash
    sudo nginx -s reload
    ```

</details>

This will make nginx server static files and folder in `contents` directory of each machine.

Which means on hitting `cdn.kunals.me` the files and folders in `contents` folder will be served. 

# Setting DNS 

Now lets point `cdn.kunals.me` to each **IP** address of our servers. You heard it right, one domain name 
will point to multiple _IP_ address using request distribution logic.

Our **DNS** of choice is [**Gcore DNS**](https://gcore.com/dns), reason?. It has _free_ **geoDNS** support. Go ahead and create your 
account on [Gcore](https://gcore.com/dns). 

Open the Gcore's [DNS page](https://portal.gcore.com/dns/zones)

Click on **Add Zone**

<BlogImage
    src="https://i.imgur.com/Eim3ePV.png"
    alt="Add zone demo image" 
    width={472}
    height={299}
 />

Add your domain **nameserver** to Gcore.

<BlogImage 
    src="https://i.imgur.com/6bxHP3s.png"
    alt="Add domain name"
    width={717}
    height={320}
/>

After your domain name is Active, lets create some *A* records.

Make sure you have **Interface mode** set to  **Advance**

<BlogImage  
    src="https://i.imgur.com/Zz8bcFr.png"
    alt="Interface mode"
    width={277}
    height={125}
/>

Click on Add a _Record Set_

<BlogImage
    src="https://i.imgur.com/0dQNy38.png"
    alt="new records set"
    width={368}
    height={174}
/>

Add an **A** with name `cdn.kunals.me` ( replace it with your domain). And click on **Geo Distance** to select  _geoDistance_
preset.

Fill each **IP** address in the records.

<BlogImage
    src="https://i.imgur.com/ebIygs0.png"
    alt="add a record"
    width={497}
    height={235}
/>

After filling all the 3 records, click on **Create**.

Now we should able to hit `cdn.kunals.me` and get the empty directory served by nginx.

## Uploading content to our network.

Anything that is present in `contents` directory will be served. Our task is to put items in this directory
across all servers. 

<br />
<details>
    <summary>See how to do it with **Ansible**</summary>

    Create a new ansible playbook called `scp.yml`

    ```yml title="scp.yml"
    - name: Transfer files using scp
        hosts: azure_vms
        vars:
            file_path: null # Path to the file you want to transfer
        tasks:
            - name: SCP file to VM
            shell:
                cmd: sshpass -p {{ ansible_ssh_pass }} scp {{ file_path }} {{ ansible_user }}@{{ ansible_host }}:/home/custom-cdn/contents
            delegate_to: localhost
    ```

    when running this playbook specify the `file_path` variable you want to send.

    ```bash
    ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini scp.yml -e "file_path=/home/kunal/hello.txt"  
    ```

    This way we will store any file in `contents` folder of every server.

</details>

When doing it manually, for _EVERY SERVER_

We can use `scp` - Secure Copy. An SSH based file transfer utility. 

```bash
scp new_file.txt custom-cdn@10.10.10.10:/home/custom-cdn/contents

# Replace 10.10.10.10 to actual server IP
```

# Finally

We are able to store content to our content network, any we can access it at `cdn.kunals.me`

## Bonus - Add a SSL Certificate to get `HTTPS`

<br />
<details>
    <summary>See how to do it with **Ansible**</summary>

    Create a new ansible playbook, called `install_ssl_cert.yml`

    ```yml title"install_ssl_cert.yml"
    - name: Setup SSL Certificates
    hosts: azure_vms
    become: yes
    vars:
        domain_name: cdn.kunals.me
        admin_email: email@exaple.com
    tasks:
        - name: Update apt cache
        apt: 
            update_cache: yes

        - name: Ensure Snapd is installed
        apt:
            name: snapd
            state: present
        
        - name: Install certbot 
        shell:
            cmd: snap install --classic certbot
        
        - name: Install Certificates
        shell:
            cmd: certbot --nginx -m {{ admin_email }} -d {{ domain_name }} --agree-tos --non-interactive
    ```    

    And run this playbook as

    ```bash
    ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini  install_ssl_cert.yml
    ```

</details>

When doing manually, _FOR EACH SERVER_

Install the [**certbot**](https://certbot.eff.org/)

Run this command to issue certificates.

```bash
sudo certbot --nginx
```
