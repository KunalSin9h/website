Redirecting one _URL_ to other _URL_ is a common practice.  There are _2_ HTTP Status Code for redirection, which are

| HTTP Status Code | Description        |
| :--------------- | :------------------| 
| **301**          | Permanent Redirect |
| **302**          | Temporary Redirect | 

_Their descriptions explain there existence._

There are multiple ways of redirecting, one include a traditions HTML based, where we use `<meta>` HTML tag to redirect. Like.

```html
<head>
	<meta http-equiv="Refresh" content="0; URL=https://kunalsin9h.com" />
</head>
```

Here, `content="0; ..."`, `0` is the time, _i guess in seconds_,  before redirection happens.

This approach can be a good choice if we want to show some message, using the same html page, before redirecting. 

But for this approach, you need to host the site on the server, and when request happens browser will redirect, hence this is very slow process. 

### Redirect from DNS Provider

Second approach of redirecting URL is using DNS Provider, I am using **[Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com)** here, but you can use any DNS Provider (but the steps will be different). 
I will recommend using _Cloudflare DNS_, even your domain registrar is different. 

For this we need to create a **Redirect Rule**. This can easily be done using Cloudflare dashboard.
Steps are:

1. Go to your **Domain** in Cloudflare dashboard.
2. Go to **Rules** in side panel
3. Go to **Redirect Rules**
4. Click on **Create Rule**

Now you will be given some option for creating redirect. 
You chose to redirect over all incoming traffic or create costume paths. You can refer the [documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/url-forwarding/) for more 

Single Redirects and Bulk Redirects require that youÂ [proxy the DNS records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/)Â of your domain (or subdomain) through Cloudflare.

> The above line means you must define and `A` record to `domain.com` which you want to use (in my case `singh.software`) with any `IP` but it must me **Proxied**, refer to above instruction for more information.

This is how i redirected https://singh.software to https://kunalsin9h.com

# Using Edge Functions to do Redirect

Now we are finally here, how to use edge to do HTTP redirect.

A simple googling tells us that _"Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the sources of data."_

Means edge service will store a function to all the server it has and upon request, the nearest server form the user will execute the function and give response. 

_Cold Start_ is a term used denote the time between _request_ hit the server and the _function_ is executed. For _Functions_ deployed on **Edge** network this is minimum.

Now enough theory. Let do it.

#### Creating a Worker

_Workers_ in Cloudflare are the _Function_ deployed on **Cloudflare Edge Network**. 

For this example, i am going to redirect https://kunals.me to https://kunalsin9h.com

To create a new Worker. 
1. Go to home of Cloudflare dashboard, not to any specific site.
2. Go to **Workers & Pages** 
3. Click on **Create Application**
4. Click on **Create Worker**

You will see see a very clean interface which you just have to give a name for the worker and a simple _"Hello World"_ function will be there.

    alt="Creating Worker Demo"
    src="https://i.imgur.com/KQjciDO.png"

    height={802}
/>

Go ahead and press the **Deploy** button to deploy the function.

And... Boom.. This function is deployed to every location in this map.

<BlogImage 
    alt="Cloudflare Edge Network map"
    src="https://i.imgur.com/avYa7Zn.png"
    width={796}
    height={459}
/>

You must see a URL for the function, when you try to **GET** request to the URL you will "Hello World" as body. 

Now lets edit the function to do redirect. The default "Hello World" function will look like this.

```js showLineNumbers
/**
	...
**/

export default {
	async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
		return new Response('Hello World!');
	},
};
```

We need to change the _Response_ to redirect as

```js showLineNumbers {3}
export default {
	async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
		return Response.redirect("https://kunalsin9h.com", 301);
	},
};
```

Save and deploy the code, now when you hit the URL again, you will be redirected to the specified location.

Great, we have just created a HTTP redirect on **Edge**.

To add a custom domain like i have https://kunals.me  to this worker URL.

1. Go to the **Worker page**
2. Go to **Triggers**
3. And then under **Custom Domain**, add a domain

You can see in this image.

    height={801}
/>

This will take few hours to propagate, but you can still use the worker URL created by the Cloudflare for testing, it should be like `https://something.your-username.workers.dev`.

Let see the performance difference between using **Redirect Rules** vs **Workers**.

When I do the _Performance Testing_ on [Key CDN](https://tools.keycdn.com/performance), for redirect using _Workers_ we get these results. (see below)

    alt="Worker Performance Test result"
    src="https://i.imgur.com/C4EcGED.png"
    width={806}
    height={711}

And redirect using **Redirect Rules** will give these results. (see below)

### But wait... ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”

These results are very very close, is **Redirect Rules** is using **Edge**?

Yes, I missed it. Using **Redirects are happening on Edge**.

/>

As you can see from the image.

So using _Cloudflare Redirect Rules_ is equal in performance as redirecting with _Cloudflare Worker Functions_. But It must/should be faster then naive HTML `<meta />` tag redirect. Lets see.

Running same performance test for redirect using HTML `<meta>` tag as explain in the beginning from the server in _Central India (Pune) .

I have using https://r.kunalsin9h.com to redirect to https://kunalsin9h.co for this example.

    height={704}
/>

As expected very slow for all locations except _Bangalore_. Also We are getting `200` Response code means the time here is for reaching the destination.

### Redirecting at Web Server Level

Redirecting using _Web Server_ like **Nginx**. We can redirect URL at _Web Server_ level. Using _Nginx_ we can redirect with a _nginx.conf_ file as:

```nginx showLineNumbers
server {
        listen 80;
        server_name rn.kunalsin9h.com;

        if ($host = rn.kunalsin9h.com) {
                return 301 https://kunalsin9h.com;
        }
}
```

The server same,  it is at _Central India (Pune)_. lets see the performance test results.

# What !ðŸ’€

It _Connected_ so fast, means **Connection Time** for redirect is fast for all cases. That means **TTFB** - Time for First Byte - is the real measurement for performance here.

Hence, we can clearly see how _TTFB_ for **Edge** redirect is so small as compared to _Nginx_ (centralized server) one.

While using all these domains, the speed difference I noticed is as follows:

From Fast to Less Fast:
1. https://kunals.me (using edge functions)
2. https://singh.software (using redirect rules)
3. https://rn.kunalsin9h.com (using nginx)
4. https://r.kunalsin9h.con (using html meta tag)

Peace.
