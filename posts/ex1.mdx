Elixir is a High Level, Dynamic, Functional Programming language based on Erlang Development Platform. Erlang is designed to create scalable, distributed, and fault-tolerant systems. Elixir is a modern replacement for Erlang Programming language which also runs on Erlang VM. Both language are inter compatible and can easily share libraries.

#### The Elixir Programming language

The Elixir programming language is more compact, clean and easy to write and maintain.

Today we are going to start a tour of elixir language, these are my notes while learning elixir from the book _"Elixir in Action, Second Edition"_ by _Sasa Juric_. I have always used conventional note book for writing technical notes, mainly notes when learning new programming language and i think they are not that useful, hence this is me trying to take notes on [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and later publish on my [blog](https://kunalsin9h.com/blog).

> **Note**: This is not a guide, nor a tutorial, it is just what i may have written in my note book, so these are think form the language which i kept for future reference, i.e this series will mostly contain `nontrivial` concepts and constructs.

Here is the beautiful book cover picture.

I am pretty sure that this will be more usable and effective that note books, because i find my self writing lots of notes in my [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/kunalsin9h), from which i take reference a lot.

**So lets start**

### Installation

Elixir can be installed from the official [installation guild](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) , what i have seen is for most (if not all) OS have `elixir` package for elixir.

For me, on Arch linux, the command is

```bash
sudo pacman -s elixir
```

This will install both `elixir` and `erlang`.
As elixir will run on Erlang VM, called as `BEAM`, we also need `Erlang` on the system.

#### Interactive Shell

`elixir` comes with an _interactive shell_ like _node_, _python_ and many more, which can be starting by running `iex` (_**i**nteractive **e**li**x**ir_).

```bash
iex
```

for me, i can see something like this.

```bash
$ iex
Erlang/OTP 26 [erts-14.0.1] [source] [64-bit] [smp:4:4] [ds:4:4:10] [async-threads:1] [jit:ns]

Interactive Elixir (1.15.0) - press Ctrl+C to exit (type h() ENTER for help)
iex(1)>
```

see i am using `Erlang` version `26` and `Elixir` version `1.15.0`.

Running `iex` starts an instance of the `BEAM` and then starts an
interactive Elixir shell inside it.

Now we can execute an expression by directly typing on shell.

```bash
iex(3)> 1 + 2
3
iex(4)>
```

here `1 + 2` is an expression which resulted in `3` .

> **Note**: Everything in Elixir is an **expression**, even `if` and `case`.
>
> I think this is because `Elixir` is a functional programming language, so passing of data between functions is very important as the data is itself is `immutable`

Any valid `elixir` code can be executed in the shell, even multi line commands,

```bash
iex(7)> 1 + (
...(7)>   2 * 3
...(7)> ) / 4
2.5
iex(8)>
```

- `iex` is provided by a module called [`IEx`](https://hexdocs.pm/iex)

```bash
iex(9)> h IEx
```

#### Variables

```bash
iex(7)> my_name = "Kunal Singh"
"Kunal Singh"
iex(8)> my_name = 20
20
iex(9)> my_name
20
iex(10)> my_name = [1, 2, 3]
[1, 2, 3]
iex(11)> my_name
[1, 2, 3]
iex(12)>
```

- Dynamic Type

In Elixir terms, assignment is called _Binding_. When
you initialize a variable with a value, the variable is bound to
that value.

Variables name

```bash
valid_variable_name
also_valid_1
validButNotRecommended
NotValid
```

variable names can end with a **?** and **!**,

> what!

```bash
iex(1)> a? = "A"
"A"
iex(2)> b! = "B"
"B"
iex(3)> a?
"A"
iex(4)> b!
"B"
iex(5)>
```

**About `Rebinding` (reassigning) variables**

Rebinding doesnâ€™t mutate the existing memory location. It
reserves new memory and reassigns the symbolic name to the
new location.

> Because here (in erlang / elixir eco) data is `immutable`

Elixir is a **Garbage Collected** language, which will clean all these memory allocation, without any manual maneuver.

> I have mixed feeling about this, as language like `Rust` handle memory without garbage collector, which increases the performance of the language.
