## Operator

Most of the operators are defined in the `Kernel` module.

Arithmetic Operator: `+`, `-` , `*` and `/`.

Comparison Operator:
    
| Operator            | what                                                               |
| --------------------| -------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `===`, `!==`        | strict equality/inequality                                         |
| `==`, `!=`          | weak equality/inequality                                           |
| `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`| Less then, greater then, less then equal to, greater then equal to |


Strict equality / inequality operator is just like JavaScript's strict equality / inequality operator.

```bash
iex(2)> 1 == 1.0
true
iex(3)> 1 === 1.0
false
iex(4)>
```


Boolean Operator: `or`, `and` and `not`

These operators are actually functions in the `Kernel` module, so we can call `Kernel.+(a, b)`, one use case will to use then with _Capture Operator `&`_, like

```elixir showLineNumbers 
defmodule Main do

  def main do

    add = &Kernel.+/2

    mul = &*/2 

    add.(3, 3) + mul(3, 3)
  end

end

IO.puts(Main.main)
```

# Macros

Macros are arguably one of the most important features Elixir
brings to the table, compared to plain Erlang. They make it
possible to perform powerful code transformations in compile
time, thus reducing boilerplate and providing elegant, mini-
DSL constructs.

> They are similar idea to `Rust` macros

- They are code generator, they take code as input and produce code as output
- They do this at compile time.

I will place the macro related code in sometime...

# Misc

1. `--no-halt` for allowing `BEAM` to not terminate after finishing the code.
	This is most often useful if your main code (outside a module)
starts concurrent tasks that perform all the work. In this
situation, your main call finishes as soon as the concurrent
tasks are started, and BEAM is immediately terminated (and
no work is done). Providing the `--no-halt` option keeps the
entire system alive and running.

2. `mix` **Elixir Build Tool**
`mix` is used to manage project, formatter, manage dependencies, it is build tool.

To create a new project.
```bash 
mix new project_name
```


To compile the project.
```bash
mix compile 
```

To format the code 
```bash
mix format
```

There are more commands, just do `mix help`

```bash
$ mix help
mix                   # Runs the default task (current: "mix run")
mix app.config        # Configures all registered apps
